    "\n",
    "The edit distance is a measure for the  similarity of two strings. It counts the minimum number of operations required to transform one string into another. The operations considered for the edit distance are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tInsert a character\n",
    "2.\tDelete an existing character\n",
    "3.\tSubstitute a character by another\n",
    "\n",
    "When the edit distance is measured using only these three operations it is also called a 'Levensthein distance'. The edit distance has many applications, including automatic spelling correction in natural language processing or the comparison of DNA in bioinformatics.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment we are presented with a problem of assessing the minimum operations between two sets of two text strings:\n",

    "    \n",
    "There are potentially many ways to transform one string into another, and trying out all possible combinations to find the lowest cost option would be prohibitively expensive. To solve the problem more efficiently, we therefore propose an algorithm based on the solution for the longest common subsequence that was covered in class. This algortihm falls under the dynamic programming paradigm.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of Dynamic Programming is to solve a large problem that has too many potential combinations to solve greedily, by dividing it into subproblems. In contrast to divide and conquer algorithms, the subproblems in dynamic programming overlap; the solution of one subproblem depends on the solution of others.\n",
    "\n",
    "The subproblems in this case involves comparing substrings, rather than the whole string at once. The program creates a table where the two strings are compared prefix by prefix where all three operations (insert, delete and substitude) are available. Here below each operation comes with the cost of 1.\n"

Optimality is defined in terms of minimal value of the available prior cell. If there is a tie between prior cells, the algorithm always takes the diagonal."

    "While calculating the given problems along with the added problem correctly our algorithm has utilized all possible solutions (insert, delete and substitution). The subproblems and their solutions are finite and can only be of the following nature: (i-1, j), (i, j-1) and (i-1, j-1). The algorithm provides a correct solution to the above problems and it’s subproblems showing the full extent of it’s functionality as seen in the above table. We can therefore say that the algorithm can wield any of the possible solutions successfully. Now when a problem is larger (longer text strings) we can expect it to deliver the correct outcome because it is just a matter of having the recursive part of our algorithm run longer until it reaches the end. We can therefore assume that it will also prove to be correct for problems of larger size for, in a longer chain of subproblems (bigger strings of text) the subproblems will not differ in nature nor will the available solutions and the algorithm’s ability to apply them.\n",
